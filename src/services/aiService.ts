    question: "Who are the top WRs this week?",

**Tier 1 (Must-Start):**
â€¢ **Tyreek Hill** vs DEN - Elite target share with favorable coverage matchup

    description: 'Elite matchup against vulnerable secondary',
    confidence: 94,
    tag: 'FANTASY',
    category: 'fantasy' as const,
    explanation: `**Why This Makes Sense:**

Jefferson faces a Giants secondary that has surrendered the **3rd-most fantasy points** to wide receivers this season. The matchup breakdown:

â€¢ **Target Projection:** 10-12 targets (season average: 9.2)
â€¢ **Coverage Matchup:** Primarily against slot coverage, where Jefferson dominates
â€¢ **Game Script:** Vikings likely trailing, leading to pass-heavy approach
â€¢ **Weather:** Dome game, no weather concerns

**Statistical Edge:**
- Giants allow 8.2 catches per game to WR1s
- Jefferson's 28% target share jumps to 32% in negative game scripts
- Historical performance: 127 yards, 2 TDs in last Giants matchup

**Risk Factors:**
- Potential for early blowout reducing garbage time
- Jefferson dealing with minor ankle issue (probable)

**Verdict:** Strong WR1 play with ceiling for 20+ fantasy points.`,

    tag: 'FANTASY',
    category: 'fantasy' as const,
    explanation: `**Matchup Concerns:**

The Chargers defense presents multiple challenges for Mahomes:

â€¢ **Pass Rush:** 2nd in pressure rate (31.2%)
â€¢ **Secondary:** Allowing just 6.1 YPA to QBs
â€¢ **Red Zone Defense:** 1st in RZ TD%, limiting high-value scoring

**Alternative Options:**
- **Geno Smith** vs ARI (favorable home matchup)
- **Derek Carr** vs CLE (potential shootout)
- **Jared Goff** vs GB (dome environment)

**Why Mahomes Struggles Here:**
- Career 18.2 PPG average vs LAC (below season average)
- Road divisional games historically challenging
- Chiefs trending toward conservative game management

**Counterargument:**
- Elite talent can overcome any matchup
- Potential for garbage time production
- Travis Kelce healthy and productive

**Recommendation:** If you have a solid QB alternative, consider the pivot.`,

    title: 'Lakers Under 112.5 Points Tonight',
    description: 'Pace concerns and defensive matchup favor Under',
    confidence: 82,
    tag: 'BETTING',
    category: 'betting' as const,
    explanation: `**Betting Analysis:**

Tonight's Lakers total looks inflated based on recent trends:

**Key Factors Supporting Under:**
â€¢ **Pace Down:** Lakers averaging 97.8 possessions (down from 101.2 early season)
â€¢ **Opponent Defense:** Facing 7th-ranked defensive efficiency
â€¢ **B2B Fatigue:** Second night of back-to-back, legs typically heavy
â€¢ **Injury Report:** AD questionable, impacts offensive flow

**Historical Trends:**
- Lakers 4-1 to Under in last 5 road games
- Team averages 108.3 PPG on second night of B2Bs
- Opponent holds teams to 106.8 PPG at home

**Line Movement:**
- Opened at 114.5, down to 112.5 (sharp money on Under)
- 67% of handle on Over, but line moving opposite direction

**Risk Assessment:**
- Blowout could lead to garbage time scoring
- LeBron capable of explosive offensive games
- Potential for overtime extending total

**Lean:** Under 112.5 at current number provides value.`,
